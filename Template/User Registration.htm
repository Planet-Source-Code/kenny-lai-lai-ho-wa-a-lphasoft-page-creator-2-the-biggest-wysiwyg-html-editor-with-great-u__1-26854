Preview="NOTE - For security reasons, some web servers do not allow self-registration. When you save this page to a Web, FrontPage will test for this capability, and show the file in the Component Errors summary in Report View if there is a problem. Self-registration is not allowed on Microsoft web servers that use Windows NT accounts to establish web permissions."

PREVIEW="User Registration Form - When this page is configured properly and saved in a Root Web on a web server, this form will allow users to register themselves as valid users of a FrontPage sub web on the same web server. The target sub web must exist when users submit this form. To configure this page, first edit the form's properties to set the name of the target sub web. Then use the Search/Replace feature to change all instances of the text [Name of your sub web] on this page with the title of the target sub web, such as &quot;New Ideas Web&quot; or &quot;Employee Discussion Web&quot;. Save this page in the Root Web. Next, change the permissions for the target sub web using the Security-&gt;Permissions command on the Tools menu. Make the permissions unique for the target sub web, and change the User access controls so that only registered users may enter."

<p>You can automatically register yourself to be a user of [Name of your sub
web] by filling out and submitting this form. Only registered users are allowed
into [Name of your sub web]. Choose a username for yourself (such as your last
name) and make sure this username contains no spaces. Also create a private
password. Together these will be your &quot;key&quot; into [Name of your sub
web] from now on. This information will be kept in a registration database that
is accessible only to the webmaster, not to ordinary users.</p>
<p>One of the main benefits of having a protected web like [Name of your sub
web] is that authorized users don't have to keep typing their names into form
fields, such as when submitting an article to a discussion group, because the
web server already knows who they are. Similarly, other users can be reasonably
sure that you really sent the articles and postings attributed to you, and that
someone else didn't pretend to be you when posting.</p>
<p>After you are successfully registered, your web browser will ask you to type
in your username and password the first time you try to access [Name of your sub
web]. The browser will remember this information for as long as it continues to
run, so you can access any document in [Name of your sub web] without being
asked for it again.</p>
